# RL_Maze_Solver

Generates and solves mazes in the shortest path using simple MDP solving techniques like Value Iteration. All algorithms are coded from scratch.

(Policy Iteration, Q-learning, potentially MCTS to be added later)

### Running the code

Simply download the files and run the code of the algorithm you want to use to solve the maze:
